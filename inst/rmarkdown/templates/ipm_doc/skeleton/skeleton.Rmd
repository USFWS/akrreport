# Introduction 

This Inventory and Monitoring Plan (IMP) outlines natural resource surveys that will be conducted at `r refuge.name` National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) within the **XXX** Complex. The plan is valid for 15 years from the approval date and may be amended if the Refuge's Comprehensive Conservation Plan (CCP) is updated and/or a Habitat Management Plan (HMP) is completed, or if another need for revision is identified. Selected surveys have been identified as necessary for achieving the Refuge mission and informing management of priority habitats and/or species. Selected surveys may be ongoing surveys that 1) estimate a resource of concern's (ROC) current state for state-dependent management, 2) improve understanding of ROC response to management, or 3) are part of a regional and/or national survey effort. This IMP was developed according to the Inventory and Monitoring (I&M) policy (701 FW 2) for the National Wildlife Refuge System. 

## Refuge Establishment

Insert establishment authority or explanation from CCP

For more information about the Refuge’s history, purpose and resources, please see please `r refuge.name` NWR’s CCP [https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/DownloadFile/8142](https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/DownloadFile/8142) and/or website [https://www.fws.gov/refuge/red_rock_lakes/](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/red_rock_lakes/). 

# Methods 

The Refuge participated in an evaluation process to identify and prioritize all current, planned, expected, or desired surveys. Below is an outline of the survey prioritization and selection process. 

* Refuge staff identified the top **X** biological priorities for `r refuge.name` NWR and reviewed existing CCP objectives[^1] (Appendix I) to ensure they were specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-bound (SMART). Identifying the Refuge's biological priorities facilitates appropriate annual planning to ensure the complete workflow for priority surveys, from data collection to informing management decisions, can be completed with existing staff capacity.

* All current, planned, expected, or desired surveys are identified. Refuge staff summarized background information for each survey prior to prioritization. The Zone Biologist facilitated a one-day workshop ***Date*** to prioritize and rank all listed surveys. Participants included:                  	
	 
* Surveys are ranked and prioritized into *Selected*, *Non-selected* or *Future*.
    * **Selected**: High priority surveys that are included in the IMP.
    * **Non-selected**: Surveys that: 
        * Have been completed;
        * Are not expected to meet National I&M policy goals of protocol development, data analysis and reporting;
        * Are conducted to assist cooperators with data collection, but where the cooperator is not expected to develop a protocol or provide information to the Refuge.
    * **Future**[^2]: Priority surveys that need: 
        * Significant additional resources not currently available;
        * Conceptual development to provide objectives linked to management priorities or efforts;
        * Partner development and contribution. 

* Selected surveys are categorized as either “current” or “expected”
    * **Current**: surveys that are highest priority I&M projects for the Refuge and are **currently conducted and have sufficient support for completion**. These surveys are the most applicable to Refuge goals and objectives. In addition, they were likely to assist many partners of the Refuge and provide assistance in landscape management.
    * **Expected**: surveys that have not yet started but have a start date within the life of the IMP as the resources necessary to complete these surveys have been identified.

* **Estimating Capacity** 
    * The staff time or dollars required to complete a survey are roughly estimated using the IMP workbook (Table 1). These estimates should be considered draft; exact values or cost estimates were not entered into PRIMR. Staff time for selected surveys were estimated based on the amount of time spent to plan, collect, analyze and use data (i.e., development of habitat management prescriptions). Costs were estimated by evaluating potential contracts, equipment, and travel accommodations that could be required each year. 

[^1]: Objectives for regional- and national-level surveys were not reviewed during this process.
[^2]: Future surveys are ranked sequentially with selected surveys with the expectation that resources sufficient to complete them could become available during the lifespan of the IMP.

# Results
 
There were `r nsurv2` priority surveys selected for this IMP. Table 1 was created using PRIMR records for selected surveys, providing essential information for each selected survey. The survey narratives provide an in depth justification, explaining the importance and purpose of each survey.
