# Overview

This R package provides R Markdown and Quarto templates for reports generated by biologists at National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska, including the Alaska Refuge Report Series.

## Installation

To use `akrreport` and generate the pdf Project Reports from the template, you'll need:

1. **R version >4.0** Available through FWS Apps-to-Go
1. **Rtools version >4.0** Available through FWS Apps-to-Go
1. **TeX** Install `tinytex` in R using the following commands and following the onscreen prompts: 

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    install.packages("tinytex")
    tinytex::install_tinytex()
    ```


## Using a Template

Install the template directly:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("usfws/akrreport")
```

This will install the package `akrreport`. Once installed, templates will be available within the R Markdown and Quarto templates as shown below:
